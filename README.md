# games.random

Build your dream game with AI, then learn how it works--one line at a time.

An AI-powered game development platform that generates complete, playable games in seconds, 
then teaches you programming through interactive code exploration. Watch your code come alive 
with real-time highlighting, AI assistance, and educational features.

## What Is This?

games.random is an educational platform that makes game programming accessible. You describe 
a game in plain English, and AI generates fully functional code. Then you can modify it, 
learn from it, and understand how it works through live highlighting and explanations.

The goal is simple: turn curiosity into coding skills by letting you play with real, 
working games while learning the patterns that make them tick.

## Features

### Educational Tools
- Live code highlighting shows function execution in real-time
- Interactive tooltips explain programming patterns on hover
- Event filtering to focus on specific game mechanics
- Automatic documentation of your game's architecture

- Export as standalone HTML (shareable, no dependencies)
- Copy to clipboard
- Reset to original at any time

## Installation

### Requirements
- Node.js 18 or higher
- Anthropic API key
- MongoDB instance
- Google OAuth credentials

### Setup

Clone and install:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shayan-Mazahir/games-random.git
cd games-random
npm install
```

Create `.env` file:

```env
PORT=3000
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/games-random
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
SESSION_SECRET=random_string_here
```

Start server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Getting API Keys

### Anthropic API
- Sign up at console.anthropic.com
- Create API key under settings

### Google OAuth
- Go to console.cloud.google.com
- Create project, enable Google+ API
- Create OAuth credentials
- Add redirect URI: `http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback`

### MongoDB
- Local: Install MongoDB Community Edition
- Cloud: Free tier at mongodb.com/cloud/atlas

## Architecture

Directory structure:

```
games-random/
├── back-end/server/
│   ├── main.js       # AI generation logic
│   └── server.js     # Express API
├── front-end/public/
│   ├── index.html    # Landing/generator
│   ├── play.html     # Editor interface
│   └── styles.css    # Styles
└── package.json
```

Flow:

```
User Input → Claude API → Code Generation → Monaco Editor → Live Game
```

Code is instrumented to trigger highlights when functions execute.
AI assistant can modify code through natural language commands.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:** Monaco Editor, p5.js, Phaser, Mermaid.js, vanilla JavaScript

**Backend:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Passport.js

**AI:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 with prompt caching (90% cost reduction)

## How Live Highlighting Works

Game functions are wrapped to trigger highlights:

```javascript
// Original
function collectCoin() {
    score += 10;
}

// Wrapped (automatic)
function collectCoin() {
    highlightCodeFunction('collectCoin', 3000);
    return _original_collectCoin.apply(this, arguments);
}
```

When `collectCoin()` runs, the editor highlights that line for 3 seconds.

## Performance

- Generation: 3-8 seconds average
- Prompt caching: 90% cost reduction on repeats
- Highlight latency: <50ms
- Typical code size: 50-500 lines
